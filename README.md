In this study, we intended to determine if SOX2+ cells in PCCs and PGLs can behave as tumour-initiating stem cells. Using expression and transcriptomic studies, we demonstrate the presence of SOX2/SOX2-expressing cells across a broad range of PCCs, PGLs, irrespective of tumour aggressivity, location, and causative mutation. In silico analyses reveal the co-expression of SOX2 and chromaffin cell markers in the tumour, and the active proliferation of these double-positive cells. Isolation of these cells in vitro in stem cell-promoting media, and their xenotransplantation on chicken chorioallantoic membranes, demonstrates that they have the potential to expand and metastasise in ovo, supporting their potential as tumour-initiating cells.
